Graph is mathematical abstract or generalization of the connection between entities. It is an important part of discrete mathematics -- graph theory.
And graph processing is widely applied in industry and science such as the `network analysis`, `graph convolutional network (GCN)`,  `probabilistic graph model(PGM)` and `knowledge graph`, which are introduced in other chapters.

A graph ${G=(V,E)}$ consists of a finite set of vertices $V(G)$ and a set of edges $E(G)$ consisting of distinct, unordered pairs of vertices, where nodes stand for entities and edges stand for their connections.
It is the foundation of **network science**.
It is  the fact that the feature is nothing except the connection that makes different from the common data.

> Graphs provide a powerful way to represent and exploit these connections.
> Graphs can be used to model such diverse areas as computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems. [^12]

The connections can be directed, weighted even probabilistic. It can be studied from the perspectives of matrix analysis and discrete mathematics.   

All data in computer machine is digitalized bits. The primitive goal is to represent graph in computer as one data structure.

> **Definition**:  Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph with $V(G) = {1,\dots,n}$ and $E(G) = {e_1,\dots, e_m}$. Suppose each
> edge of $G$ is assigned an orientation, which is arbitrary but fixed. The (vertex-edge)
> `incidence` matrix of $G$, denoted by $Q(G)$, is the $n \times m$ matrix defined as follows.
> The rows and the columns of $Q(G)$ are indexed by $V(G)$ and $E(G)$, respectively.

> is $\color{red}{\text{1 or −1}}$ according as $e_j$ originates or terminates at $i$, respectively. We often denote
> $Q(G)$ simply by $Q$. Whenever we mention $Q(G)$ it is assumed that the edges of $G$ are oriented.

|The adjacency matrix|

> **Definition**: Let $G$ be a graph with $V(G) = {1,\dots,n}$ and $E(G) = {e_1,\dots, e_m}$.The `adjacency` matrix of $G$, denoted by $A(G)$, is the $n\times n$ matrix defined as follows. The rows and
> the columns of $A(G)$ are indexed by $V(G)$. If $i \not= j$ then the $(i, j)$-entry of $A(G)$ is $0$ for vertices $i$ and $j$ nonadjacent, and the $(i, j)$-entry is $\color{red}{\text{1}}$ for $i$ and $j$ adjacent. The $(i,i)$-entry of $A(G)$ is 0 for $i = 1,\dots,n.$ We often denote $A(G)$ simply by $A$.

> `Adjacency Matrix` is also used to represent `weighted graphs`. If the $(i, j)$-entry of $A(G)$ is $w_{i, j}$, i.e. $A[i][j] = w_{i, j}$, then there is an edge from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ with weight $w$.
> The `Adjacency Matrix` of `weighted graphs` $G$ is also called `weight` matrix of $G$, denoted by $W(G)$ or simply by $W$.

See *Graph representations using set and hash* at <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-representations-using-set-hash/>.

> **Definition**: In graph theory, the degree (or valency) of a vertex of a graph is the number of edges incident to the vertex, with loops counted twice. From the wikipedia page at <https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Degree_(graph_theory)>.
> The degree of a vertex $v$ is denoted $\deg(v)$ or $\deg v$. `Degree matrix` $D$ is a diagonal matrix such that $D_{i,i}=\sum_{j} w_{i,j}$ for the `weighted graph` with $W=(w_{i,j})$.

> **Definition**: Let $G$ be a graph with $V(G) = {1,\dots,n}$ and $E(G) = {e_1,\dots, e_m}$.The `Laplacian` matrix of $G$, denoted by $L(G)$, is the $n\times n$ matrix defined as follows. The rows and

> In other words, the $(i,i)$-entry of $L(G)$, ${L(G)}_{i,j}$, is defined by
> $${L(G)}_{i,j} = D - A = \begin{cases} \deg(V_i) & \text{if $i=j$,}\\ -1  & \text{if $i\not= j$ and $V_i$ and $V_j$ is adjacent,} \\ 0  & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}$$
> Laplacian matrix of  a  graph $G$ with `weighted matrix` $W$ is ${L^{W}=D-W}$, where $D$ is the degree matrix of $G$.
> We often denote $L(G)$ simply by $L$.

> **Definition**:  A *directed graph* (or `digraph`) is a set of vertices and a collection of directed edges that each connects an ordered pair of vertices. We say that a directed edge points from the first vertex in the pair and points to the second vertex in the pair. We use the names 0 through V-1 for the vertices in a V-vertex graph. Via <https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42digraph/>.


`Adjacency List` is an array of lists.  An entry array[i] represents the list of vertices adjacent to the ith vertex. This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph. The weights of edges can be represented as lists of pairs.
See more representation of graph in computer in <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-data-structure-and-algorithms/>.
Although the adjacency-list representation is asymptotically at least as efficient as the adjacency-matrix representation, the simplicity of an adjacency matrix may make it preferable when graphs are reasonably small. Moreover, if the graph is unweighted, there is an additional advantage in storage for the adjacency-matrix representation.

It seems that graph theory is partially the application of nonnegative matrix theory.
[Graph Algorithms in the Language of Linear Algebra](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9780898719918?mobileUi=0) shows how to leverage existing parallel matrix computation techniques and the large amount of software infrastructure that exists for these computations to implement efficient and scalable parallel graph algorithms. The benefits of this approach are reduced algorithmic complexity, ease of implementation, and improved performance.

> **Definition** A `walk` in a digraph is an alternating sequence of vertices and
edges that begins with a vertex, ends with a vertex, and such that for every edge
$\left<u\to v\right>$ in the walk, vertex $u$ is the element just before the edge,
and vertex $v$ is the next element after the edge.

A payoff of this representation is that we can use matrix powers to count numbers
of walks between vertices. The adjacent matrix ${A(G)}^k$ provides a count of the number of length $k$
walks between vertices in any digraph $G$.

**Definition** The length-k walk counting matrix for an n-vertex graph $G$ is
the $n \times n$ matrix $C^{k}$ such that:
$$
C_{uv}^{k} ::= \text{the number of length-k walks from $u$ to $v$}.
$$

> The length-k counting matrix of a digraph $G$ is ${A(G)}^k$, for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$.


> **Definition** A **walk** in an undirected graph is a sequence of vertices, where each successive pair of vertices are adjacent; informally, we can also think of a walk as a sequence of edges.
> A walk is called a **path** if it visits each vertex at most once.
> For any two vertices $u$ and $v$ in a graph $G$, we say that $v$ is reachable from $u$ if $G$ contains a walk (and therefore a path) between $u$ and $v$.
>An undirected graph is connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex.
> A **cycle** is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex and has at least one edge.

#### Operators on Graph

We will limit our attention to undirected graphs and view them as a discrete analog of manifolds. We define the vertex set $V={1,\dots,n}$ (it can be any set containing n objects, which we canonically map to the above set of natural numbers from 1 to n); the edge set and the edge set $E\subset V\times V$. An undirected graph has $(i,j)\in E⇔(j,i)\in E$. We further define the `vertex weights` as the function $a:V\to (0,\infty)$ and the `edge weights` as $w:E\to \mathbb R_+$ (in fact, w can be defined on the entire $V×V$ with $w_{ij}=0$ meaning $(i,j)\not\in E$). We refer to the tuple $G=(V,E,a,w)$ as to a `weighted undirected graph`.

If $G(V, E)$ is undirected graph. $V$ are vertices, $E$ are edges, T are triangles/3-cliques, i.e., if $(i, j, k)\in T\iff \{i , j\}, \{j , k\}, \{k, i\}\in E.$

* Function on vertices(vertex field): $s : V \to \mathbb R$;
* Edge flows(edge field ): $X:V\times V\to \mathbb R$, where  $X(i, j)=0,$ if $(i, j)\not\in E$ and $X(i, j)=-X(j,i)$ for all $(i, j)$.
* Triangular flows: $\Phi: V\times V\times V\to\mathbb R$ where $\Phi(i, j ,k)=0$ if $(i, j, k)\not\in T$ and $\Phi(i, j, k)=\Phi(k, i, j)=\Phi(j, k, i)=-\Phi(j, i, k)=-\Phi(i, k, j)=-\Phi(k,j,i)$ for all $i, j, k$.

#### Shortest Paths

In graph theory, the `shortest path` problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.

Given the start node and end node, it is supposed to identify whether there is a path and find the shortest path(s) among all these possible paths.

The distance between the node $u$ and $v$ is the minimal number $k$ that makes $A^{k}_{uv}>0$.
Given two nodes $E_1, E_2$ in graph $\mathrm{G}$, if we would like begin from the node $E_1$ to the end node $E_2$, we must judege that if there is a path from $E_1$ to $E_2$ before finding the shortest way.
In the perspective of optimization, the feasible domain is finite in the shortest path problem.

#### Depth-first Search and Breadth-First

Because it is unknown whether there is a path between the given nodes, it is necessary to take the first brave walk into a neighbor of the start node $E_1$.

Breadth first search explores the space level by level only when there are no more states to be explored at a given level does the algorithm move on to the next level.
We implement BFS using lists open and closed to keep track of progress through the state space.
In the order list, the elements will be those who have been generated but whose children have not been examined.
The closed list records the states that have been examined and whose children have been generated.
The order of removing the states from the open list will be the order of searching.
The open is maintained as a queue on the first in first out data structure.
States are added to the right of the list and removed from the left.

<img src="https://kobiso.github.io//assets/images/graph/depth.png" width ="50%" /><img src="https://kobiso.github.io//assets/images/graph/breadth.png" width ="50%" />

After initialization, each vertex is enqueued at most once and hence dequeued at most once.
The operations of enqueuing and dequeuing take $O (1)$ time, so the total time devoted to queue operations is $O (v)$.
Because the adjacency list of each vertex is scanned only when the vertex is dequeued, the adjacency list of each vertex is scanned at most once.
Since the sum of the lengths of all the adjacency lists is the $ta(E)$, at most $O(E)$ time is spent in total scanning adjacency lists.
The overhead for the initialization is $O(v)$, and thus the total running time of BFS is $O(v+E)$. Thus, breadth first search runs in time linear in the size of the adjacency list representation.


In depth first search, when a state is examined all of its children and their descendants are examined before any of its siblings. Depth first search goes deeper into the search space whenever this is possible, only when no further descendants of a state can be found, are its siblings considered.

A depth first traversal takes O(N*E) time for adjacency list representation and $O(N^2)$ for matrix representation.

#### $A^{\ast}$ Algorithm

 As introduced in wikipedia, $A^{\ast}$ algorithm has its advantages and disadvantages:
> In computer science, $A^{\ast}$ (pronounced "A star") is a computer algorithm that is widely used in path finding and graph traversal, which is the process of finding a path between multiple points, called "nodes". It enjoys widespread use due to its performance and accuracy. However, in practical travel-routing systems, it is generally outperformed by algorithms which can pre-process the graph to attain better performance, although other work has found $A^{\ast}$ to be superior to other approaches.


First we learn the **Dijkstra's algorithm**.
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. It was conceived by computer scientist [Edsger W. Dijkstra](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) in 1956 and published three years later.

For example, we want to find the shortest path between a and b in the following graph.
The distance of every pair is given.

1. the distance to its neighbors is computed:

a(0)| 2 | 3 | 6
----|---|---|---
0   |7  | 9 | 14


2. as the first step, compute the distance to all neighbors:

 2  | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 6 |
----|---|---|---|---|---|
  0 | 10| 15|0  | 11| 2 |

Now we have 2 choices from 1 to 3: (1) $1\to3\mid 9$;(2) $1\to 2\to3\mid (7+10=17 >9)$. And we find all paths from 1 to 3 and the shortest path from 1 to 3  is $1\to3$ with distance 9.

From 1 to 4: (1) $1\to2\to4\mid 7+15=22$; (2) $1\to3\to4\mid 9+11=20<22$.
the shortest path from 1 to 6  is $1\to3\to4$ with distance 20.

From 1 to 6: (1) $1\to6\mid 14$; (2) $1\to3\to6\mid 9+2=11<14$.
the shortest path from 1 to 6  is $1\to3\to6$ with distance 11.

3. distance to neighbor:

 4  | b | 6 | b |
----|---|---|---|
  0 | 6 | 0 | 9 |

 $1\to3\to4\to b\mid 9+11+6=26$ and
 $1\to3\to6\to b\mid 9+2+9=20<26$ is the shortest.

#### Graph adjacency matrix duality

Perhaps even more important is the duality that exists with the fundamental
operation of linear algebra (vector matrix multiply) and a breadth-first search (BFS)
step performed on G from a starting vertex s:
$$
BFS(G, s) \iff A^T v, v(s)=1.
$$

This duality allows graph algorithms to be simply recast as a sequence of linear
algebraic operations. Many additional relations exist between fundamental linear
algebraic operations and fundamental graph operations

#### Directed Acyclic Graph

`Directed acyclic graph (DAG)` is the directed graph without any cycles. It is used widely in scheduling, distributed computation.


> **Definition** The acyclic graph is called `forest`. A connected acyclic graph is called a `tree`.

A graph $G$ is a tree if and only if $G$ is a forest and $|V(G)|=|E(G)| + 1$.

Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge ${uv}$, vertex ${u}$ comes before ${v}$ in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

#### Chemical Graph Theory

Graph theory applied in the study of molecular structures represents an interdisciplinary science, called `chemical graph theory` or `molecular topology`.

A chemical graph  is a model of a chemical system, used to characterize   the
interactions among its components: atoms, bonds, groups of atoms or molecules. A structural formula
of a chemical compound can be represented by a molecular graph, its
vertices being atoms and edges corresponding to covalent bonds.
Usually hydrogen atoms are not depicted in which case we speak of `hydrogen depleted molecular graphs`.

In a `multigraph` two points may be joined by more than one line.
If multibonds are taken into account, a variant of adjacency matrix $A(G)$ , denoted $C(G)$, (the connectivity matrix) can be written:
$$
{[C]}_{ij}=\begin{cases} b_{ij} &\text{if $i\not=j$ and $(i, j)\in E(G)$},\\
0 &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
where $b_{ij}$ is the conventional bond order: 1; 2; 3; 1.5 for simple, double, triple and
aromatic bonds, respectively.

`Distance Matrix` $D(G)$, is a square
symmetric table, of size $n\times n$, similar to adjacency matrix by replacing the entity of topological distance:
$$
{[D]}_{ij}=\begin{cases} d_{ij} &\text{if $i\not=j$},\\
0 &\text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
where $d_{ij}$, the topological distance between $i$ and $j$.

M. V. Diudea, I. Gutman and L. Jantschi in [Molecular Topology](http://lori.academicdirect.org/books/pdf/2001_moltop.pdf) claims that
> A single number, representing a chemical structure, in graph-theoretical terms, is called a `topological descriptor`. Being a structural invariant it does not depend on the labeling or the pictorial representation of a graph. Despite the considerable loss of information by the projection in a single number of a structure, such descriptors found broad applications in the correlation and prediction of several molecular properties1,2 and also in tests of similarity and isomorphism.

The simplest TI is the half sum of entries in the adjacency matrix $A$:
$$A=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}{[A]}_{ij}.$$

**The Indices of Platt, F, Gordon-Scantlebury, N2, and Bertz, B1**：
$$F={\sum}_{i}\sum_{j}{[EA]}_{ij}=2\sum_{i}C_{2}^{\delta_i}=2 N2=2 B1$$
where $EA$ is the Edge Adjacency matrix. This index is twice the Gordon - Scantlebury
index, N2 , defined as the number of modes in which the acyclic fragment C-C-C may be
superposed on a molecular graph
$$N2=\sum_{i}{(P_2)}_i.$$
This index equals the number of all paths of length 2, P2 , in graph.
The last one can be calculated combinatorially from the vertex degree, $\delta_i$ .

***
First TIs based on adjacency matrix (i.e., based on connectivity) were introduced
by the Group from Zagreb:
$$
M_1=\sum_{i}\delta_i^2, \\
M_2=\sum_{(i,j)\in E(G)}\delta_i\delta_j
$$
where $\delta_i, \delta_j$ are the vertex degrees for any two adjacent vertices.

**The Randic Index, $\chi$**
$$\chi=\sum_{(i,j)\in E(G)}(\delta_i\delta_j)^{-\frac{1}{2}}
$$
$\chi$ - called the connectivity index, is calculated on edge, by using the vertex degrees of its endpoints.
The $\chi$ values decrease as the branching increases within a set of alkane isomers.
They increase by the number of atoms in the molecular graph.

It can extended the summation over all paths of
length $e$:
$$\chi^{e}=\sum_{p_e}(\delta_i\delta_j\cdots \delta_{e+1})^{-\frac{1}{2}}
$$
where $(\delta_i, \delta_j, \cdots, \delta_{e+1}$ are the vertex degrees along the path $p_e$.

****
**Wiener-Type Indices**
In `acyclic structures`, the Wiener index, W and its extension, the hyper-Wiener
index, WW can be defined as
$$
W=W(G)={\sum}_e N_{i,e}N_{e,j} \\
WW=WW(G)={\sum}_e N_{i,p}N_{p, j}
$$

where $N_i$ and $N_j$ denote the number of vertices lying on the two sides of the edge $e$ or
path $p$, respectively, having the endpoints $i$ and $j$.
Other main definitions38,39 of the Wiener-type indices are based on the distance matrices,
$$
W=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}\sum_{j}{[D_e]}_{ij},\\
WW=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}\sum_{j}{[D_p]}_{ij}.
$$

#### Graph Partitioning

**Definition**: `Separators` A subsect of vertices ${C}$ of a graph ${G}$ with ${n}$ vertices is an $f(n)$-separator that $\delta$-splits if $|C|<f(n)$ and vertices $G-C$ can be partitioned into two sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ such that $|A|, |B|<\delta n$ and there is no edge between ${A}$ and ${B}$, where $f$ is a positive function and $0<\delta < 1$.

> The fundamental problem that is trying to solve is that of splitting a large irregular graphs into ${k}$ parts. This problem has applications in many different areas including, parallel/distributed computing (load balancing of computations), scientific computing (fill-reducing matrix re-orderings), EDA algorithms for VLSI CAD (placement), data mining (clustering), social network analysis (community discovery), pattern recognition, relationship network analysis, etc.
> The partitioning is usually done so that it satisfies certain constraints and optimizes certain objectives. The most common constraint is that of producing equal-size partitions, whereas the most common objective is that of minimizing the number of cut edges (i.e., the edges that straddle partition boundaries). However, in many cases, different application areas tend to require their own type of constraints and objectives; thus, making the problem all that more interesting and challenging!
>
> The research in the lab is focusing on a class of algorithms that have come to be known as multilevel graph partitioning algorithms. These algorithms solve the problem by following an approximate-and-solve paradigm, which is very effective for this as well as other (combinatorial) optimization problems.
>
> [Over the years we focused and produced good solutions for a number of graph-partitioning related problems. This includes partitioning algorithms for graphs corresponding to finite element meshes, multilevel nested dissection, parallel graph/mesh partitioning, dynamic/adaptive graph repartitioning, multi-constraint and multi-objective partitioning, and circuit and hypergraph partitioning.](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/projects)

Let $P = \{p_i, \cdots, p_n \}$ be a set of ${n}$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$. For each $p_i\in P$, let $N(p_i)$ be a closest
neighbor of ${p}$ in ${P}$, where ties are broken arbitrarily. Similarly, for any integer ${k}$, let $N_k(p_i)$ be the
set of ${k}$ nearest neighbors of ${p}$ in ${P}$, where the ties too are broken arbitrarily.

**Definition**  A ${k}$-nearest neighborhood graph of  $P = \{p_i, \cdots, p_n \}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$
, is a graph with
vertices $V = {1, \cdots,n}$, and edges ${E}$,

$$ E = \{ (i, j) \mid p_i\in N_k(p_j)\quad \text{or}\quad p_j \in N_k(p_i) \}. $$

#### Spectral Graph  Theory

As the title suggests, `Spectral Graph  Theory` is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices associated
with graphs, and their applications.
---|---
---|---
Adjacency matrix| ${A}$
Degree matrix | ${D}$
Laplacian matrix| ${L}$

For the symmetric matrix $L = D - A$, we can obtain that $x^T Lx=\sum_{(u,v)\in E}(x_u-x_v)^2$. If the graph ${G}$ is directed, then $x^T Lx=\sum_{(u,v)\in E}w(u,v) (x_u-x_v)^2$.
> Let $G = (V;E)$ be a graph, and let $\lambda=(\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n)^T$ be the eigenvalues of
its Laplacian matrix. Then, $\lambda_2>0$ if and only if G is connected.

There are many iterative computational methods to approximate the eigenvalues of the graph-related matrices.


#### PageRank

Raluca Tanase and Remus Radu, in [The Mathematics of Web Search](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/Winter2009/RalucaRemus/index.html), asserted that
> The usefulness of a search engine depends on the relevance of the result set it gives back. There may of course be millions of web pages that include a particular word or phrase; however some of them will be more relevant, popular, or authoritative than others. A user does not have the ability or patience to scan through all pages that contain the given query words. One expects the relevant pages to be displayed within the top 20-30 pages returned by the search engine.
>
> Modern search engines employ methods of ranking the results to provide the "best" results first that are more elaborate than just plain text ranking. One of the most known and influential algorithms for computing the relevance of web pages is the Page Rank algorithm used by the Google search engine. It was invented by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were graduate students at Stanford, and it became a Google trademark in 1998. The idea that Page Rank brought up was that, _the importance of any web page can be judged by looking at the pages that link to it_. If we create a web page i and include a hyperlink to the web page j, this means that we consider j important and relevant for our topic. If there are a lot of pages that link to j, this means that the common belief is that page j is important. If on the other hand, j has only one backlink, but that comes from an authoritative site k, (like www.google.com, www.cnn.com, www.cornell.edu) we say that k transfers its authority to j; in other words, k asserts that j is important. Whether we talk about popularity or authority, we can iteratively assign a rank to each web page, based on the ranks of the pages that point to it.

PageRank is the first importance measure of webpage in large scale application. And this is content-free so that it does not  take the relevance of webpages into consideration.

<img title = "page rank" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8b/PageRanks-Example.jpg/800px-PageRanks-Example.jpg" width="47%"/>

Here's how the PageRank is determined. Suppose that page $P_j$ has $l_j$ links. If one of those links is to page $P_i$, then $P_j$ will pass on $1/l_j$ of its importance to $P_i$. The importance ranking of $P_i$ is then the sum of all the contributions made by pages linking to it. That is, if we denote the set of pages linking to $P_i$ by $B_i$, then
$$I(P_i)=\sum_{P_j\in B_i}\frac{I(P_j)}{l_j}.$$

Note that the importance ranking of $P_i$ is the finite sum of 2 factors: the importance of its neighbors' importance $I(P_j)$ and the number of links $l_j$ when $P_j\in B_i$ thus it can be rewritten as
$$I(P_i)=\sum_{j} [I(P_j)\cdot \frac{1}{l_j}] \mathbb{I}(ij)$$
where the indicator function $\mathbb{I}(ij)$ is equal to 1 if the page $P_i$ is linked with the page $P_j$.
If we define a matrix, called the hyper-link matrix, $\mathbf{H}=[\mathbf{H}_{ij}]$ in which the entry in the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column is
$$
[\mathbf{H}_{ij}]=
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{l_j}\quad &\text{if $P_j\in B_i$},\\
0 \quad & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$



The condition above defining the PageRank $I$ may be expressed as

$$ I = {\bf H}I  $$
In other words, the vector I is an eigenvector of the matrix H with eigenvalue 1. We also call this a stationary vector of H.

It is not very simple and easy to compute the eigenvalue vectors of large scale matrix.
If we denote by $\bf 1$the  $n\times n$  matrix whose entries are all one, we obtain the _Google matrix_:

$$ {\bf G}=\alpha{\bf S}+ (1-\alpha)\frac{1}{n}{\bf 1}  $$
Notice now that G is stochastic as it is a combination of stochastic matrices. Furthermore, all the entries of G are positive, which implies that G is both primitive and irreducible. Therefore, G has a unique stationary vector I that may be found using the power method.

#### Spectral Clustering Algorithm

Spectral method is the kernel tricks applied to [locality preserving projections](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2359-locality-preserving-projections.pdf) as to reduce the dimension, which is as the data preprocessing for clustering.

In multivariate statistics and the clustering of data, spectral clustering techniques make use of the spectrum (eigenvalues) of the `similarity matrix` of the data to perform dimensionality reduction before clustering in fewer dimensions.
The similarity matrix is provided as an input and consists of a quantitative assessment of the relative similarity of each pair of points in the data set.

**Similarity matrix** is to measure the similarity between the input features $\{\mathbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^{n}\subset\mathbb{R}^{p}$.
For example, we can use Gaussian kernel function
$$ f(\mathbf{x_i},\mathbf{x}_j)=exp(-\frac{{\|\mathbf{x_i}-\mathbf{x}_j\|}_2^2}{2\sigma^2}) $$
to measure the *similarity* of inputs.
The element of *similarity matrix* $S$ is $S_{i, j} = exp(-\frac{{\| \mathbf{x_i} -\mathbf{x}_j\|}_2^2}{2\sigma^2})$.
Thus $S$ is symmetrical, i.e. $S_{i, j}=S_{j, i}$ for $i,j\in\{1,2,\dots, n\}$.
If the sample size $n\gg p$, the storage of **similarity matrix** is much larger than the original input $\{\mathbf{x}_i \}_{i=1}^{n}$, when we would only preserve the entries above some values.
The **Laplacian matrix** is defined by $L=D-S$ where $D = Diag\{D_1, D_2, \dots, D_n\}$ and
$D_{i} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} S_{i,j} = \sum_{j=1}^{n} exp(-\frac{{\|\mathbf{x_i} - \mathbf{x}_j\|}_2^2}{2\sigma^2})$.

Then we can apply *principal component analysis* to the *Laplacian matrix* $L$ to reduce the data dimension. After that we can perform $K-means$ or other clustering.

#### Graph Kernel

Like kernels in **kernel methods**, graph kernel is used as functions measuring the similarity of pairs of graphs.
They allow kernelized learning algorithms such as support vector machines to work directly on graphs, without having to do feature extraction to transform them to fixed-length, real-valued feature vectors.

**Definition** : Find a mapping $f$ of the vertices of $G_1$ to the vertices of $G_2$ such that $G_1$ and $G_2$ are identical;
i.e. $(x, y)$ is an edge of $G_1$  if and only if $(f(x),f(y))$ is an edge of $G_2$.
Then ${f}$ is an isomorphism, and $G_1$ and $G_2$ are called `isomorphic`.

No polynomial-time algorithm is known for graph isomorphism.
Graph kernel are convolution kernels on pairs of graphs. A graph kernel makes the whole family kernel methods applicable to graphs.

`Von Neumann diffusion` is defined as
 $$K_{VND}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{\alpha}^{k}{A}^{k}=(I-\alpha A)^{-1}, \alpha\in[0,1].$$

`Exponential diffusion` is defined as $K_{ED}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k!}{\alpha}^{k}{A}^{k}=\exp(\alpha A)$.
`Katz method` is defined as the truncation of `Von Neumann diffusion`
$$S_K=\sum_{k=0}^{K}{\alpha}^{k}{A}^{k}=(I-\alpha A)^{-1}(\alpha A-{\alpha}^K {A}^K).$$

### Semi-supervised Learning based Graph

`Dirichlet energy functional` is defined as
$$\mathbb{E}(f)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{U}{\|\nabla f\|}^2\mathrm d x$$
$$\mathbb{E}(f)=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i, j}w_{i,j}{\|f_i -f_j\|}^2\implies f(h)=\frac{\sum_{i}w_{i,h}f(i)}{\sum_i w_{i,h}}$$


### Link Prediction

The above algorithms are unsupervised algorithms so what is the supervised algorithms in graph data sets? Do prediction algorithms such as classification and regression matter?

* [Link Prediction Based on Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09691)
* [Chapter 9. Link Prediction algorithms@neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-algorithms/current/algorithms/linkprediction/index.html)

### Probability on Graph

It is to answer the question how to characterize a network in the term of some summary statistic.
The following distribution may be the key:

* the distribution of the degree;
* the distribution of the eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix;
* random matrix and dynamical network.

A particle moves around the vertex-set ${V}$. Having arrived at the vertex $S_n$ at time n, its next position Sn+1 is chosen uniformly at random from the set of neighbours of $S_n$.
The trajectory of the particle is called a
symmetric random walk (SRW) on ${G}$.
Two of the basic questions concerning symmetric random walk are:
1. Under what conditions is the walk recurrent, in that it returns (almost surely) to its starting point?
2. How does the distance between S0 and Sn behave as $n\to\infty$?

### Computational Graph

Computational graphs are a nice way to think about mathematical expressions, where the mathematical expression will be in the decomposed form and in topological order.

[To create a computational graph, we make each of these operations, along with the input variables, into nodes. When one node’s value is the input to another node, an arrow goes from one to another. These sorts of graphs come up all the time in computer science, especially in talking about functional programs. They are very closely related to the notions of dependency graphs and call graphs. They’re also the core abstraction behind the popular deep learning framework `TensorFlow`.](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/)
Computational graph is an convenient representation of the work flow or process pipeline, which describes the dependence/composite relationship of every variable.
Additionally, each composite relationship is specified.

Decision tree looks like simple graph without loops, where only the leaf nodes specify the output values and the middle nodes specify their test or computation.
